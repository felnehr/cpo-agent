# CPO-Assistant
A Next.jsâ€“powered internal tool that leverages Anthropic Claude for guided conversation, codifies best practices and edge-case thinking, and automatically creates structured tickets in Linear.

CPO-Assistant is an MVP for a Chief Product Officer companion: it interviews you via a chat UI to gather precise requirements, surfaces best practices, and then programmatically pushes fully scoped, optimized issues into your Linear project. Built with Next.js, the Anthropic Claude API, and the Linear SDK.
